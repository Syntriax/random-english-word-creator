# Random Englis-Like Word Creator

I just needed a word creator online that looked like they could be real words but were randomly generated, but I couldn't find them on my 10 seconds Google search, so rather spent few tens of minutes to just to write the most basic version that uses the percentages from this letter frequency table: http://www.cs.trincoll.edu/~crypto/resources/LetFreq.html

Yes, I was bored. Eh, I had fun xD
